# SDRP: Self-Healing Polymers for Space Habitats and Satellites

## Project Overview
In Martian environments, inflatable habitats are at risk of damage due to the extreme environmental conditions which could pose risk to the crew in such habitats. This project explores the design and simulation of a light-activated self-healing polymer composite that is able to mitigate the damage caused by Martian conditions. The simulations show the effect of the micrometeoroid damage on the polymer and the healing process triggered subsequently by light with an overall aim of net reduction damage over time in comparison to non-healing materials. This research could help with the development of advanced materials that would improve habitat durability increasing duration and safety of human missions on mars. 

## Research Question
Can I design and model a light-activated self-healing polymer composite tailored for micrometeoroid damage repair in inflatable space habitats on Mars?

## Hypothesis
It is possible to design a light-activated self-healing polymer composite which can repair micrometeoroid damage in inflatable space habitats on Mars by using simulations to predict responses to mechanical damage and its healing responses under Martian conditions.
