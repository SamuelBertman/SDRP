## Project Overview
This project aims to explore the design and simulation of a novel, light-activated self-healing polymer composite that can autonomously repair micrometeoroid damage in inflatable habitats intended for Mars missions. The goal is to use computational chemistry and materials modelling to evaluate the feasibility and optimize the polymer’s healing efficiency under Martian environmental conditions.
