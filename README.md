# SDRP: Light-Activated Self-Healing Polymers for Martian Habitats

## Executive Summary
Designing the future of Martian habitats demands materials that *self-heal* under harsh space conditions to ensure safety during long-term missons. This project develops and simulates a **novel light-activated self-healing polymer composite**, engineered to autonomously repair micrometeoroid damage, radiation-induced defects, and thermal cycling stress in inflatable habitats on Mars. My work pushes the boundaries of aerospace materials science by delivering a polymer system that *increases habitat durability, mission duration, and crew safety*, this project addresses a critical bottleneck in a long-term human presence on Mars.

## Scientific Objective
- model, design and validate a **polymer composite capable of repeated autonomous self-healing** triggered by light exposure under Martian environmental parameters.
- Quantify damage accumulation and healing kinetics under simulated micrometeoroid impact, radiation, and extreme thermal gradients.
- Demonstrate net durability gain compared to non-healing polymers, setting precedence of design rules for next-gen aerospace materials.

## Strategic Significance
- First computational model integrating **molecular dynamics, finite element analysis, and environment-driven light activation** in a Mars habitat polymer composite.
- Addresses a significant aerospace materials challenge: **extending operational life of inflatable space structures with minimal maintenance**.
- Generates predictive frameworks to accelerate experimental validation and aerospace qualification.

## Methods & Tools
- **Materials Studio**: Molecular design and initial polymer configuration.
- **Python + Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)**: Custom scripts for polymer lattice damage and healing simulations.
- **LAMMPS / GROMACS**: High-fidelity molecular dynamics simulating micrometeoroid impacts and radiation damage.
- **COMSOL Multiphysics**: Thermal and structural finite element simulations under Martian conditions.
- **MATLAB**: Integrated modeling of healing kinetics and environmental parameter variations.

## Key Simulation Assumptions (Justified)
- Polymer modeled as a 2D reactive lattice for computational tractability; next phase will scale to 3D models.
- Light-triggered healing modeled as a consistent activation stimulusâ€”baseline scenario before variable illumination studies.
- Martian environmental constants reflect mean conditions to establish foundational response metrics.
- Control (non-healing) polymer modeled for rigorous comparative durability benchmarking.

## Deliverables
- **Fully documented simulation codebase** with modular, extensible architecture.
- **Comprehensive report (PDF + blog post)** detailing methodology, results, and aerospace implications.
- **Visual models and plots** demonstrating damage accumulation and healing progression.
- Ongoing GitHub updates reflecting continuous integration of new data and models.
