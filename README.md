# SDRP: Self-Healing Polymers for Space Habitats and Satellites

## Project Overview
This project aims to explore the design and simulation of a novel, light-activated self-healing polymer composite that can autonomously repair micrometeoroid damage in inflatable habitats intended for Mars missions. The goal is to use computational chemistry and materials modelling to evaluate the feasibility and optimize the polymerâ€™s healing efficiency under Martian environmental conditions.

## Research Question
Can I design and model a light-activated self-healing polymer composite tailored for micrometeoroid damage repair in inflatable space habitats on Mars?

## Hypothesis
It is possible to design a light-activated self-healing polymer composite which can repair micrometeoroid damage in inflatable space habitats on Mars by using simulations to predict responses to mechanical damage and its healing responses under Martian conditions.
