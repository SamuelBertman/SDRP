## Simulation Assumptions

- The polymer will be modeled as a 2D grid.
- Random damage will occur at set time steps.
- When light is present, the 2D grid will begin to fill the holes (heal damage).
- The light intensity will be constant throughout the simulation.
- Mars environment parameters will be modeled as fixed constants, ignoring rare or inconsistent events.
- The control material will not heal and will accumulate damage over time.

## Project Overview
In Martian environments, inflatable habitats are at risk of damage due to the extreme environmental conditions which could pose risk to the crew in such habitats. This project explores the design and simulation of a light-activated self-healing polymer composite that is able to mitigate the damage caused by Martian conditions. The simulations show the effect of the micrometeoroid damage on the polymer and the healing process triggered subsequently by light with an overall aim of net reduction damage over time in comparison to non-healing materials. This research could help with the development of advanced materials that would improve habitat durability increasing duration and safety of human missions on mars. 

## Research Question
Can I design and model a light-activated self-healing polymer composite tailored for micrometeoroid damage repair in inflatable space habitats on Mars?

## Hypothesis
It is possible to design a light-activated self-healing polymer composite which can repair micrometeoroid damage in inflatable space habitats on Mars by using simulations to predict responses to mechanical damage and its healing responses under Martian conditions.

# Mechanics of light-activated self-healing polymer networks (Yu, Xin, & Wang, 2019)

## Healing Mechanism Overview
The light propagation through the material matrix triggers the production of free radicals that facilitate the interfacial self-healing process. Polymer chains diffuse across the interface and re-form the dynamic bonds assisted by the free radicals. The interfacial self-healing strength of the polymer increases with the light illumination time until reaching a plateau.

## Different ways they function
Relying on encapsulates of curing agents or various dynamic bonds activate the interfacial bridging mechanism when the fractured interfaces are brought into contact. External visible or ultraviolet (UV) light activates the self-healing reaction around the fracture interface.

## Photophores (the light-trigger)
“Photophore” is incorporated within the polymer network, photo-responsive chemical group. Light-triggered free radicals will activate the photophore to facilitate the polymer-chain rebinding. Two types of photophores exist — organic and inorganic, organic contain organic chemical groups, inorganic have metal-organic frameworks and nanoparticles/sheets.

## Unknowns and Challenges in Modeling
How to model the light-activated interfacial self-healing behavior remains elusive. How the light activates the photophores during the self-healing process remains unknown. How the light-triggered free radicals activate the polymer chain evolution around the healing interface remains unclear. And how the light properties including intensity and wavelength affect the self-healing performance is also ambiguous.

## Polymer used (light-activated self-healing)
Optically healable TiO2 nanocomposite hydrogels

# self-healing polyurethane based on dynamic covalent bonds (An et al., 2023)

## Dynamic Bond Benefit
Dynamic covalent bonding used to maintain mechanical stress whilst self healing

## Material Focus
Polyurethane was the focus material

## Types of Self-Healing in Polyurethane
Two types of self healing around PU, extrinsic and intrinsic, extrinsic is the introduction of dynamic reversible structures (dynamic covalent bonds + non dynamic covalent interactions).

## Healing Reaction
Dynamic covalent bonds require 4 reaction steps to heal - reversible cycloaddition, exchange reactions, stable free radical mediated reshuffling and heterocyclic compound facilitated bond reformations.

## Temperature Considerations
Can be low temperature reactions for self healing but not sufficient mechanical stability.

## Need for Multi-Network Systems
Single dynamic covalent network polymers no longer sufficient, multi-network required (have high self healing and mechanical strength retainability)

## Nanofiller Addition
Nano fillers can be added to improve interaction for healing

# Self-healing waterborne polyurethane - matrix for preparing nano composite coating h-BN/GO/NiO (Kianfar et al., 2024)

## Properties
Self-healing waterborne polyurethane - matrix for preparing nano composite coating h-BN/GO/NiO.
SBWPU containing 20% of healing agent showed anti-corrosion properties.
Gradually loose function from physical damage.

## Enhancing Base Properties
Introducing covalent structures into waterborne polyurethane increases mechanical stability + lifetime.
External stimuli such as light triggers reversible covalent bonds in polymer networks forming new bonds.
Introducing Diimine-DiOH produces good mechanical strength coating polymer WPU.

## Importance of Aromatic Schiff Base
Focus on Aromatic Schiff base compounds are easily synthesised, good self healing, work through visible light, and rigid structure so high mechanical performance.
Polyurethane on its own has low mechanical strength but with specific amounts of aromatic Schiff base groups could increase this in addition to 2D nano sheets h-BN.

## Fix: Compatibility Needed
h-BN sheets and WPU aren’t compatible but w non covalent functionalizing boron nitride w GO makes them compatible.

## Healing Mechanism
Intrinsic-based healing 

## Data
With the parameters of Schiff based waterborne polyurethane w Diimine-DiOH had self healing efficiency of 80.03% under visible light, healing time of 24h at ambient temps and tensile strength of 17.88 MPa and mechanical resistance of 20.80 MPa.

# Self-Healing in Epoxy Thermoset Polymer Films Triggered by UV Light (Moniruzzaman et al., 2016)

## Types of Self-Healing Mechanisms
There are other forms of healing – capsule-based, vascular, and intrinsic.

## Polymer Focus
Focuses on cured epoxy thermoset resins modified with epoxy-functionalised photoresponsive azobenzene molecule – without resin capsules or other components not chemically joined.

## Methods Used
Study done using nanoindentation and atomic force microscopy (AFM).

## Self-Healing Mechanism
Showed good self-healing under UV irradiation only.
Uses intrinsic healing mechanism triggered by UV-induced trans → cis isomerization of the azobenzene chromophore (photophore), which enables self-healing.
Azobenzene is a highly abundant light-responsive molecule – changes to isomerisation of the azobenzene chromophores (reversible and repeatable isomerisation changes).
UV light changes thermodynamically more stable trans-azobenzene to less stable cis form.
Visible light converts cis back to trans.

## Possible Space Applications
Photoisomerization of azobenzene under UV light caused the polymer matrix to undergo bulk diffusion even below its Tb or Tm, which is favorable for space applications due to low ambient temperatures.

## Research Gap
Self-healing has been seen in azobenzene-based gels and soft polymers, but no reports exist on azobenzene-based rigid and toughened resins.
