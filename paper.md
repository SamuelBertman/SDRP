## Simulation Assumptions

- The polymer will be modeled as a 2D grid.
- Random damage will occur at set time steps.
- When light is present, the 2D grid will begin to fill the holes (heal damage).
- The light intensity will be constant throughout the simulation.
- Mars environment parameters will be modeled as fixed constants, ignoring rare or inconsistent events.
- The control material will not heal and will accumulate damage over time.

## Project Overview
In Martian environments, inflatable habitats are at risk of damage due to the extreme environmental conditions which could pose risk to the crew in such habitats. This project explores the design and simulation of a light-activated self-healing polymer composite that is able to mitigate the damage caused by Martian conditions. The simulations show the effect of the micrometeoroid damage on the polymer and the healing process triggered subsequently by light with an overall aim of net reduction damage over time in comparison to non-healing materials. This research could help with the development of advanced materials that would improve habitat durability increasing duration and safety of human missions on mars. 

## Research Question
Can I design and model a light-activated self-healing polymer composite tailored for micrometeoroid damage repair in inflatable space habitats on Mars?

## Hypothesis
It is possible to design a light-activated self-healing polymer composite which can repair micrometeoroid damage in inflatable space habitats on Mars by using simulations to predict responses to mechanical damage and its healing responses under Martian conditions.


## Mechanics of light-activated self-healing polymer networks (Yu, Xin, & Wang, 2019)

Healing Mechanism Overview
The light propagation through the material matrix triggers the production of free radicals that facilitate the interfacial self-healing process. Polymer chains diffuse across the interface and re-form the dynamic bonds assisted by the free radicals. The interfacial self-healing strength of the polymer increases with the light illumination time until reaching a plateau.

Different ways they function
Relying on encapsulates of curing agents or various dynamic bonds activate the interfacial bridging mechanism when the fractured interfaces are brought into contact. External visible or ultraviolet (UV) light activates the self-healing reaction around the fracture interface.

Photophores (the light-trigger)
“Photophore” is incorporated within the polymer network, photo-responsive chemical group. Light-triggered free radicals will activate the photophore to facilitate the polymer-chain rebinding. Two types of photophores exist — organic and inorganic, organic contain organic chemical groups, inorganic have metal-organic frameworks and nanoparticles/sheets.

Unknowns and Challenges in Modeling
How to model the light-activated interfacial self-healing behavior remains elusive. How the light activates the photophores during the self-healing process remains unknown. How the light-triggered free radicals activate the polymer chain evolution around the healing interface remains unclear. And how the light properties including intensity and wavelength affect the self-healing performance is also ambiguous.
