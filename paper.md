## Simulation Assumptions

- The polymer will be modeled as a 2D grid.
- Random damage will occur at set time steps.
- When light is present, the 2D grid will begin to fill the holes (heal damage).
- The light intensity will be constant throughout the simulation.
- Mars environment parameters will be modeled as fixed constants, ignoring rare or inconsistent events.
- The control material will not heal and will accumulate damage over time.
