Self-healing = capability of material to recover from physical damage 

Built from diff methods: diffusion and flow, shape-memory effects, heterogeneous self-healing systems, covalent-bond reformation and reshufflingm dynamics of supramolecular chemistry.

Healing property based on thermal transitions, network heterogeneities, localized chemical reactions.

Poly(acrylate amide)
Elastomers Reinforced with Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxanes
. visible light
. solidlike at high cross-linking density
. viscous liquid at low shear rate
. healing rate at 30 degree celsius was about 12 hours
. was able to take around 90% strain at 3h, 140% at 6h, 210% at 9h and 230% at 12h with uncut at 245%
. does not state if repeat healing abilities
. temperature effect not tested 
. uncut the material takes 0.6MPa stress at a 245% strain
. does not state if can handle radiation
