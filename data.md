Self-healing = capability of material to recover from physical damage 

Built from diff methods: diffusion and flow, shape-memory effects, heterogeneous self-healing systems, covalent-bond reformation and reshufflingm dynamics of supramolecular chemistry.

Healing property based on thermal transitions, network heterogeneities, localized chemical reactions.

Poly(acrylate amide)
Elastomers Reinforced with Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxanes
. visible light
. solidlike at high cross-linking density
. viscous liquid at low shear rate
. healing rate at 30 degree celsius was about 12 hours
. was able to take around 90% strain at 3h, 140% at 6h, 210% at 9h and 230% at 12h with uncut at 245%
. does not state if repeat healing abilities
. temperature effect not tested 
. uncut the material takes 0.6MPa stress at a 245% strain
. does not state if can handle radiation

Ethylenediamine-Polyurea Microcapsule Epoxy
. doesn't specify if UV or visible light
. solid via solidification 
. liquid isocyanates
. self-healing process occurs mostly within 72 to 144 hours after damage, stabilizes around 144h mark, after 366h, aprroximately nearly fully healed
. at 25 degrees celsius
. does not mention if can repeatedly heal
. doesn't specify if able to heal if too cold
. doesn't specify if break easy
. doesn't specify if handle radiation

Polyurethane Elastomers
. UV light - can cure entire layer of resin at once exposure
. gel
. 12h healing process - near complete
. 80 degrees celsius
. can heal repeatedly however decreasing healing efficiencies of ~95%, 87%, and 60% tensile strengths with each of the 3 breaks tested
. does not specify if heals at low temperatures (implies not effectively based on 80 degree celsius)
. 3.39MPa with 0.09 +- standard deviation (tensile strength)
