## Poly(acrylate amide) Elastomers Reinforced with Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxanes (Wang & Urban, 2020)
**Source**: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41578-020-0202-4  
**Light Trigger**: visible light  
**State**: solidlike at high cross-linking density; viscous liquid at low shear rate  
**Healing Performance**: healing rate at 30 degree celsius was about 12 hours; was able to take around 90% strain at 3h, 140% at 6h, 210% at 9h and 230% at 12h with uncut at 245%  
**Temperature Tested**: 30 degree celsius  
**Mechanical Strength**: uncut the material takes 0.6MPa stress at a 245% strain  
**Repeat Healing?**: does not state if repeat healing abilities  
**Radiation Info?**: does not state if can handle radiation  
**Notes**: temperature effect not tested

- https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsapm.8b00116  
**Light Trigger**: doesn't specify if UV or visible light  
**State**: solid via solidification; liquid isocyanates  
**Healing Performance**: self-healing process occurs mostly within 72 to 144 hours after damage, stabilizes around 144h mark, after 366h, approximately nearly fully healed  
**Temperature Tested**: 25 degrees celsius  
**Mechanical Strength**: not specified  
**Repeat Healing?**: does not mention if can repeatedly heal  
**Radiation Info?**: doesn't specify if handle radiation  
**Notes**: doesn't specify if able to heal if too cold; doesn't specify if break easy

- https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/13/2/326  
**Light Trigger**: UV light - can cure entire layer of resin at once exposure  
**State**: gel  
**Healing Performance**: 12h healing process - near complete  
**Temperature Tested**: 80 degrees celsius  
**Mechanical Strength**: 3.39MPa with 0.09 +- standard deviation (tensile strength)  
**Repeat Healing?**: can heal repeatedly however decreasing healing efficiencies of ~95%, 87%, and 60% tensile strengths with each of the 3 breaks tested  
**Radiation Info?**: not specified  
**Notes**: does not specify if heals at low temperatures (implies not effectively based on 80 degree celsius)

- https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsmacrolett.9b00766  
**Light Trigger**: UV light  
**State**: solid  
**Healing Performance**: 1 to 3h for near-complete healing  
**Temperature Tested**: 100 degrees celsius  
**Mechanical Strength**: cannot handle too high of stress, breaks at 3.7MPa roughly  
**Repeat Healing?**: able to repeat heal due to S-S bonds  
**Radiation Info?**: excessive/long-term UV radiation cause weakening  
**Notes**: heat accelerates healing, assumption that at low temps, healing would be heavily decreased, not enough energy for S-S bonds to reform
