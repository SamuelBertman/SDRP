# Radiation (UV Exposure) ✅
## Mars UV Spectrum Overview (Patel et al., 2002)
UV Range: 190–410 nm, UV-A/B present, UV-C rare but highly damaging to material
Dust effects: High dust loading reduces direct UV, but diffuse UV remains sufficient for light-triggered materials
UV Flux: UV-A/B reliably available; UV-C rare
Biological significance: UV-C highly damaging but uncommon
Effect on light-triggering: diffuse UV may activate materials

## Mars Environmental Parameters for Simulation (Amils et al., 2007)
Radiation exposure: Estimated solar UV flux, UVA/UVB relevant to photoinitiators
Rationale: Most probable condition affecting polymer

## Mars Greenhouse Material Notes (Clawson, 2007)
Mars UV intense in UVB (280–315 nm) and UVC (200–280 nm)
Accelerated lab tests: UV flux multiplied 2–7×
UV stress combined with mechanical loading accelerates polymer degradation

## Notes on Outgassing (Pastore et al., 2020)
Hard vacuum (10⁻⁵ mbar) + thermal cycling causes polymer chain modifications
Outgassing releases residual monomers/additives → micro-defects
Thermal bake-out may improve sealing layer performance

## Mars Suit Material Notes (Marcy et al., 2004)
EVOH for pressure/bladder layer
PET/EVOH co-extrusions, PTFE, PVDC coatings
Multi-layer laminates protect against low pressure

# Temperature Extremes & Thermal Cycling ✅
## Martian Environmental Parameters for Simulation (Amils et al., 2007)
Low temperature: −35°C

## A ground‐to‐exosphere Martian general circulation model (González-Galindo et al., 2009)
Thin atmosphere → day: 20°C, night: −73°C
Rapid heating/cooling → large thermal swings

## Biodegradable Thermoplastic Elastomers (McMullin et al., 2016)
POSS content improves stiffness, elastic recovery, and stability across temp fluctuations
Prestraining improves recovery
Crystallinity enhances mechanical stability and healing at low temps

## PE-LLD Degradation Under Multiple Stressors (Corti et al., 2010)
Thermal aging accelerates oxidation and biodegradation
Synergistic effects with UV + fungi observed

## Self-Healing Materials for Space Applications (Pernigoni et al., 2021)
Thermal cycling range −120 °C to +120 °C can induce cracking, deformation, aging

# Micrometeoroid Impacts ✅
## High Survivability of Micrometeorites on Mars (Tomkins et al., 2019)
Mars: lower energy collisions but more frequent, higher particle survival
Flux: ~0.29–0.59 g/m²/year

## Self-Healing Materials for Space Applications (Pernigoni et al., 2021)
Small debris (<1 mm): minor erosion
Larger debris (~1 cm): potential catastrophic failure

# simulation requirements based on the previous ✅
## UV:
- need to include UV-A+B
- need to include accelerated UV scenarios (2-7x flux) to model the long-term degredation
## pressure:
- need to model a hard vacuum (~10⁻⁵ mbar), outgassing effects, and chemical degredation from perchlorates
## temperature:
- need to include daily martian swings (20°C to -73°C) and extreme thermal cycles (-120°C to 120°C) - incorporating crystallinity, prestrain, and elasticity
## micrometeroid damage:
- need to sim small debris (<1mm) and larger debris (1cm) with a flux of about 0.29 to 0.59 g/m²/year
## impacts from factors
- need to include UV, thermal + mechanical loading effects on polymer chain integrity and healing performance
