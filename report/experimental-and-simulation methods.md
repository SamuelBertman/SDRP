# Accelerated UV (long-term sims) & PAR Testing (light in visible spectrum)
## . simulating UV and visible light effect on polymer - to use for healing sim
- Multi-sample tensile creep apparatus (Clawson, 2007) - used to relate light-exposure with mechanical performance
- Xenon-arc lamps, radial placement, UV intensity ±10–20% - used to replicated martian irradiance (how much sunlight hits the surface of Mars)
- diffuse light setup - used to simulate broad-spectrum light on Mars (covers all the different wavelengths of light that could effect the polymer)

# Creep / Mechanical Testing
## . simulating mechanical durability and stress recovery after repeated cycles
methods:
- radical sample placement
- Clamp displacement measurement
- Stress-strain curves for repeated cycling

# Thermal & Low-Pressure Testing
## . simulating martian environment
- Hard vacuum, 10⁻⁵ mbar (Pastore et al., 2020)
- Mars: 6–7 mbar CO₂
- Thermal cycling simulated ± temperature ranges

# Molecular Dynamics & Simulation
## . predicting damage and healing over time
methods:
- MD, Lattice spring, Generalized lattice spring (Balazs et al., 2007)
- Photon-coupled MD (Zheng et al., 2018) - simulates light-activated healing
- ReaxFF simulations (Vermeersch et al., 2024) - simulates chemical reactivity and bond formation during self-healing
- Inputs: polymer chain configurations, lattice connectivity, light intensity, thermal profile, vacuum effects
