## Selection Objective

Trying to design and model a light-activated self-healing polymer composite that can withstand the extreme Martian conditions and will be able to aid in repair in space habitats.

First need to decide an existing polymer for simulation testing in Martian conditions.

## Selection Priorities

Important criteria for this polymer:

- Light-activated  
- Self-healing  
- Substantial data  
- Repeat healing  
- Realistic temperatures  

## Martian Environmental Parameters for Simulation (Amils et al., 2007)

A baseline of important factors of Martian conditions was found from current research (see `sources.md`), out of the provided conditions, the following conditions were selected for the Martian simulation environment:

- **Low Temperature**: -35°C
- **Oxidation**: perchlorates in soil, chemical degradation.
- **Radiation Exposure**: Estimated solar UV flux, particularly UVA/UVB relevant to photoinitiators.
- **Micrometeoroid Events**: Incorporated using probabilistic models from MRO data.

### Rationale

These factors were chosen because they are the most probable environmental conditions to effect the polymer.

# Data Input for Each Factor

## Low Temperature
- **POLYMER**
  - Glass transition temperature (Tg)
  - Tensile strength, flexibility
  - Thermal contraction coefficients
- **MARS**
  - -35°C

## Radiation Exposure
- **POLYMER**
  - UV absorption spectra of the polymer
  - Rate of photodegradation by UVA/UVB
- **MARS**
  - Activation efficiency of photoinitiators under Martian UV flux

## Micrometeoroid Events
- **POLYMER**
  - Self-healing response time after micrometeoroid damage
  - Damage thresholds from high-velocity impacts
- **MARS**
  - Impact frequency and energy from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter data
