### Polymers

#### Mechanics of Light-Activated Self-Healing Polymer Networks (Yu, Xin, & Wang, 2019)
- Optically healable TiO2 nanocomposite hydrogels
- Healing via free radicals triggered by light
- Photophores: organic & inorganic (both are viable)
. whichever is better in the design, either organic or inorganic photophores can be used

#### Self-Healing Polyurethane (An et al., 2023)
- Dynamic covalent bonds
- Extrinsic and intrinsic healing
- Multi-network systems with nanofillers for improved strength
. shows polyurethane (PU) is versatile for additions, PU will be the base polymer for modelling as it also supports healing

#### Self-Healing Waterborne Polyurethane (Kianfar et al., 2024)
- Matrix for nano-composite coating h-BN/GO/NiO
- Aromatic Schiff base groups enhance mechanical strength
- Intrinsic healing; light triggers reversible covalent bonds
- Self-healing efficiency 80.03%, 24h healing at ambient temps
. shiff bases will not be used as healing is too slow for Martian environment, however nano-composite coating will be used to reinforce in the final laminate model

#### Self-Healing in Epoxy Thermoset Polymer Films (Moniruzzaman et al., 2016)
- Azobenzene-functionalized epoxy
- Intrinsic UV-induced trans-cis isomerization
- Bulk diffusion below Tg/Tm favorable for space
. azobenzene groups will be used as they support healing under low Martian temps

#### Mars-Relevant Light-Responsive Polyurethane Systems (Li et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017; Aguirresarobe et al., 2016)
- AZO, SP, Coumarin-PU, Anthracene-PU, o-NB PU, RhB PU
- Photocleavage, photodimerization, reversible crosslinking
- Applications: drug delivery, shape memory, coatings
. coumarin-PU is another option for the base polymer, supporting reversible crosslinking needed for repeating healing cycles, SP, o-NB and RhB will not be used due to less data around them

#### Self-Healing Polymer Bilayer Films (PBFs) (Kim et al., 2020)
- Bottom: CPI, Top: PDMS + linseed oil microcapsules
- Multi-stimuli: air, moisture, heat, UV
- Rapid UV-light healing (20 min)
. microcapsules will not be included in simulations, however will include in FEA laminate models for rapid crack closure

#### Self-Healing Polyurethane Elastomers (Fang et al., 2024)
- UPy and boronic ester dynamic bonds
- Optimized ratio for strength + autonomous repair
- Multi-exponential time-dependent healing
. UPy boronic ester bonds will be used in kinetic models at mesoscale only

### Composites & Laminates

#### Self-Healing Microvascular Fiber-Composites (Patrick et al., 2014)
- Embedded 3D vascular networks
- Multi-cycle healing >100% efficiency in well-mixed regions
- Fiber bridging enhances energy absorption
. need to include vascular reinforcement as a structural-level add-on in FEA only

#### Inflatable Habitat Materials (Valle et al., 2019)
- Layers: liner, bladder, restraint, MMOD, TPS, AO
- Self-healing candidate: bladder, restraint, MMOD layers
- Creep-burst tests reveal failure modes and mechanical constraints
. the self-healing PU layers will be used in the bladder/restraint layers of the habitat and in the laminate simulations

#### Self-Healing Polymer Coatings & Composites (Lee et al., 2015)
- Coatings + fabrics: PDMS + PRC nanofibers restore interfacial adhesion
- Limitations: large separations reduce self-healing
- PRC nanofibers in PDMS
- Mechanical cycling: preserves stiffness after repeated damage
- Recovery via polymerization of monomers from fiber cores
. will not use nanofibre coating, maybe as a secondary protective layer

### Coatings & Barrier Layers

#### Mars Suit Material Notes (Marcy et al., 2004)
- EVOH, PET/EVOH, PTFE, PVDC layers as barriers
- Protect gases, moisture, UV, and chemicals
. barrier layers will be modelled using non-healing coatings

#### Outgassing Notes (Pastore et al., 2020)
- CF-epoxy, GF-epoxy, KF-epoxy: stability and pre-conditioning
. polymer will be pro-conditioned in sims to account for Martian vacuum exposure
