LARC™-CP1 (colourless polyimide developed by NASA): 
- degredation accelerated by stress
- high UV-resistance
- high UV and stress causes embrittlement
. mechanism - stress lowers the chain rupture activation energy -> UV forms radicals which leads to chain scission (longer chain split into shorter chains) = faster creep (slow, permanent deformation) mainly tertiary (accelerated strain)

**[note]** creep acceleration needs to be coded based on stress + UV levels

PE-LLD (linear, low density polyethylene):
- degradation accelerated by UV, thermal, and fungal exposure
. mechanism - oxidation degredation -> more degredation 

# Mechanical Stress / Creep
## (Yuan et al., 2021)
- Creep stages: primary, secondary, tertiary
- UV + mechanical stress reduces activation energy → chain scission
- Models: Maxwell, Voigt, Kelvin, generalized Voigt-Kelvin, Arutyunyan model

# Thermal Effects
## (Tavanaei et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2006; Montarnal et al., 2011; Cash et al., 2015; Wojtecki et al., 2016)
- Thermal cycling: rapid heating/cooling on Mars
- Thermal aging: PE-LLD, POSS elastomers
- Intrinsic/self-healing polymers: Vitrimers, epoxy/PCL blends affected

# Chemical / Oxidative Effects
## (Pernigoni et al., 2021)
- Perchlorate oxidation: reduces modulus & fracture toughness 
- Synergistic effects: UV + oxidation + thermal stress
- Extrinsic healing systems vulnerable; intrinsic systems more robust

# Multi-Stressor / Synergistic Effects
## (Tavanaei et al., 2022)
- PE-LLD: sunlight + fungi + thermal → 20% faster oxidation, higher CO₂ evolution
- Cumulative stress accelerates creep, chain scission, embrittlement
- Relevant for Martian polymer longevity
