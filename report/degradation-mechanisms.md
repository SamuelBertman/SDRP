LARC™-CP1 (colourless polyimide developed by NASA): 
- degredation accelerated by stress
- high UV-resistance
- high UV and stress causes embrittlement
. mechanism - stress lowers the chain rupture activation energy -> UV forms radicals which leads to chain scission (longer chain split into shorter chains) = faster creep (slow, permanent deformation) mainly tertiary (accelerated strain)

State variables (what is happening internally e.g. chain scission - chains split)
chain scission
effective activation energy (current activation energy - so here the stress lowers the activation energy so the current activation energy (effective) is the internal factor that has changed, e.g. activation is lower right now whereas rupture is the final value needed)
creep (permanent deformation, it is deformed, it is a set change)

relevant equations for tracking state variables in the simulation
chain scission for only UV:
dϕ​ / dt = −kUV​ϕ
ϕ = fraction of polymer chains still intact 1 = all intact, 0 = all broken, 0.75 = 75% intact (this is our chain scission value)
kUV​ = rate constant for UV-induced chain scission
d (extremely small changes of ...)

chain scission for only stress:
dϕstress / dt = −kstressϕ
kstress​ = Aexp(−(Eeff / RT))
ΔEstress ​= σ ⋅ V∗
σ = applied stress
V = activation volume (the volume of polymer that has to move before it can break due to stress)
Eeff ​= E0 ​− ΔEstress ​− ΔEox​ (ΔEox​ value calculation is later on)
E0 = baseline activation energy for chain rupture

effective activation energy effect on k:
kSO = Aexp(−(Eeff​​ / RT))
Eeff = effective activation energy (calculated via 𝐸eff = E0 - ΔEstress, E0 = baseline rupture energy, ΔEstress = energy reduction due to stress)
kSO = rate constant for chain scission under environmental factors: stress and oxidation
Aexp = how often chains attempt to rupture (chains are always vibrating so always have the chance to overcome the activation energy)

creep:
dϵter / dt ​​= kcreep​ ⋅ f(CS,Eeff​,σ)
ϵ = stress (the internal stress actually experienced by the material)
d (extremely small changes of ...) = infinitesimal changes
𝜎 = applied stress (stress applied to the material)
η = viscosity (how fast the liquid flows, high would be slow flow)
𝐸 = elastic modulus (how stiff the material is, how much it resists being deformed)
CS = number of chains breaking (chain scission)
Eeff = effective activation energy
f is just stating it is a function

PE-LLD (linear, low density polyethylene):
- degradation accelerated by UV, thermal, and fungal exposure
. mechanism - oxidation degredation -> chain scission -> embrittlement (less ductile - less able to bend, will fracture more likely)

state variable:
chain scission (same equation as before)

# Mechanical Stress / Creep ✅
## (Yuan et al., 2021)
- Creep stages: primary (decreasing strain rate), secondary (steady strain rate), tertiary (accelerating strain rate)
- UV + mechanical stress reduces activation energy → chain scission -> accelerates strain to tertiary creep
- Models: Maxwell, Voigt, Kelvin, generalized Voigt-Kelvin, Arutyunyan model

state variables:
damage parameter (represents the materials integrity - increasing value means decreasing integrity, it gets weaker)

relevant equations for tracking state variables in the simulation
damage parameter for only UV/mechanical stress:
D = 1 − ϕ
ϕ = this is the chain scission value previously calculated
This gives old D value
Dnew ​= Dold ​+ dD/dt ​⋅ Δt
dt = Δt (these values should be 10-100x less than the time value significant changes occur e.g. 1hour significant changes occur, dt could be chosen as 1 minute or 1 second)
Dold = initial damage parameter before considering stress (value is from first equation)

# Thermal Effects ✅
## (Tavanaei et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2006; Montarnal et al., 2011; Cash et al., 2015; Wojtecki et al., 2016)
- Thermal cycling: rapid heating/cooling on Mars
- Thermal aging: PE-LLD, POSS elastomers
- Intrinsic/self-healing polymers: Vitrimers, epoxy/PCL blends affected

state variable:
chain scission 

relevant equations for tracking state variables in the simulation
chain scission due to thermal exposure:
dϕ / dt = −kTϕ
kT​ = Aexp(-(Ea,T​​ / RT))
kT = thermal degredation rate constant (high temp -> high kT -> more chain scission -> more degredation)
Ea,T​​ = activation energy for thermal chain scission
Aexp = pre-exponential factor (A is how likely it attempts chain scission, exp is success rate)

crosslink density:
dν​ / dt = kheal​(1−ν) − kbreak​ν (v at the end is not an error)
kheal = healing rate
kbreak = degredation rate

damage parameter only for thermal:
Dthermal​ = 1−(ϕ⋅ν(t))
ϕ = chain scission value
ν(t) = crosslink density value (number of crosslinks present - make it stronger/stiffer) (must not be constant as healing kinetics included)

ΔDamage parameter only for thermal:
ΔDthermal ​= Dthermal ​− Dold

damage parameter including thermal, UV, and stress:
Dnew​ = Dold​ + ΔDthermal​​

# Chemical / Oxidative Effects
## (Pernigoni et al., 2021)
- Perchlorate oxidation: reduces modulus & fracture toughness 
- Synergistic effects: UV + oxidation + thermal stress
- Extrinsic healing systems vulnerable; intrinsic systems more robust

state variable:
chain scission
modulus (how stiff it is, how much it resists deformation)
damage parameter

relevant equations for tracking state variables in the simulation 
chain scission from only oxidation:
dϕ / dt = −koxϕ
𝑘𝑜𝑥 = 𝐴exp(−(𝐸𝑒𝑓𝑓 / RT))[𝑂𝑥]
ΔEox​ = α[Ox​]
[Ox​] = oxidation concentration (how much of a chemical is present that can oxidise the polymer)​
α = proportionality constant
Eeff ​= E0 ​− ΔEstress ​− ΔEox​
[𝑂𝑥] = oxidant concentration

NEED AN EQUATION TO CALCULATE THE DEGREDATION RATE INCLUDING ALL THE DIFF EQUATIONS USED TO THEN GET THE OVERALL RATE
CALCULATING v IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR HEALING KINETICS AND THIS PROJECT AS THE VALUE CANNOT BE CONSTANT AND MUST INSTEAD BE DYNAMIC
